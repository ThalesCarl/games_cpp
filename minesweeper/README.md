Game created following **javidx9** tutorial available at [Cross Platform Graphical User Interfaces in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOIbK4bJKS8)   with some improvements.

This game was created using C++ and wxWidgets framework in a Windows environtment. I intend to port it to Linux and implement it in python using PyQt5 framework some day.
